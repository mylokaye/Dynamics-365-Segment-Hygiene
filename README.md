# Dynamics 365 Segment Hygiene (Exclude poor quality records)

A powerful and customizable set of queries designed for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Journeys (formerly Marketing), enabling marketers and CRM admins to create dynamic segments to filter out poor quality records so you can send personliased campaigns with confidence.

The purpose of these queries is so that you can create a seperate segment of all contact records with bad data, which you can either exclude or send a non-personalised email. 

# 📂 **First Name Query Filter (Personalisation)**

🔠 Filters poor quality first name data, such as an empty field, period, or single characters.

```
PROFILE(contact, contact_1)
    .FILTER(contact_1.firstname == 'A' || contact_1.firstname == 'B' || contact_1.firstname == 'C' || contact_1.firstname == 'D' || contact_1.firstname == 'E' || contact_1.firstname == 'G' || contact_1.firstname == 'H' || contact_1.firstname == 'I' || contact_1.firstname == 'J' || contact_1.firstname == 'L' || contact_1.firstname == 'M' || contact_1.firstname == 'N' || contact_1.firstname == 'P' || contact_1.firstname == 'R' || contact_1.firstname == 'S' || contact_1.firstname == 'X' || contact_1.firstname == 'd' || contact_1.firstname == 'x' || contact_1.firstname == '.' || contact_1.firstname == '-' || ISNULL(contact_1.firstname))
```

# 🔍 **Query to Detect All-Caps First Names (Personalisation)**

```
FILTER(
  Contact.firstname MATCHES_REGEX "^[A-Z]+$"
)
```

# 📂 **Email Query Filter (Hygeine)**

🔠 Filters invalud characters such as dots or hyphens.

```
PROFILE(contact, contact_1)
    .FILTER(contact_1.emailaddress1 CONTAINS ',' || contact_1.emailaddress1 CONTAINS ';' || contact_1.emailaddress1 CONTAINS '(' || contact_1.emailaddress1 CONTAINS ')' || contact_1.emailaddress1 CONTAINS '"' || contact_1.emailaddress1 CONTAINS '<' || contact_1.emailaddress1 CONTAINS '>' || contact_1.emailaddress1 CONTAINS '\\' || contact_1.emailaddress1 CONTAINS '/' || contact_1.emailaddress1 CONTAINS ':')
```
